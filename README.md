# Introduction
`fiodor` is a tool for collecting I/O performance data to be used for calibrating simulations of storage systems using [SimGrid](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr). It uses [`fio`](https://github.com/axboe/fio/), *the flexible I/O tester*, for actually doing the I/O and produce the performance figures.

# Installation
To install `fiodor`, just clone this repository to your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/airnandez/fiodor.git
chmod u+x fiodor/fiodor
```

You will find a `bash` script ready to use. Note that you need to have `fio` installed on your machine (and reachable via your `$PATH`) for `fiodor` to work. To install `fio` see [https://github.com/axboe/fio](https://github.com/axboe/fio).

# Usage

```
Usage: fiodor (read|write)  [-n <num files>]  [â€“d <dir>]

where:

  -n <num files>: number of files to read or write [default: 10]
  -d <dir>:       directory where 'fio' will read or write [default: working directory]

Documentation:
   https://github.com/airnandez/fiodor
```

For instance, the command:

```
$ fiodor read  -d /tmp  -n 50
```

will configure `fio` to repeatedly (50 times in this case) write files in `/tmp` and read them back while collecting figures on `read` performance. The size of each file is ramdomly selected in the range 10MB to 1GB. The block size used for reading each individual file is also randomly selected among the values in the set { 4KB, 32KB, 256KB, 512KB, 1024KB }.

The collected I/O performance data is written to a file in CSV format in the current working directory. The output file contains a header with the meaning of each field on each record and one line per file, for instance:

```
# hostname,fstype,operation,filesize_MiB,blksize_KiB,bandwidth_KiBps,runtime_ms,iops
myhost,ext3,read,335,512,216020,1588,421
myhost,ext3,read,493,512,1045200,483,2041
myhost,ext3,read,600,32,984615,624,30769
```

Analogously, to collect data on `write` performance, use:

```
$ fiodor write  -d /tmp  -n 50
```
